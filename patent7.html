    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>This patent introduces an automatic parallel alignment device designed for electric vehicle (EV) charging platforms. The device ensures precise alignment between the EV and the charging interface, improving efficiency and safety during battery exchanges.</p>
        
        <h2>Principle:</h2>
        <p>The device includes several key components and mechanisms:</p>
        
        <h3>Parallel Positioning Components:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front and Rear Positioning Rods:</strong> These rods are fixed to the positioning module and intersect perpendicularly with a horizontal positioning bar.</li>
            <li><strong>Conical Positioning Slots:</strong> Located on the EV's battery compartment, these slots engage with the positioning rods to ensure proper alignment.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Automatic Parallel Adjustment Mechanism:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjustment Motor and Gears:</strong> A motor and gear system drives the alignment process, ensuring the EV is properly positioned relative to the charging platform.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Cross-shaped Lifting Platform:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to lift the EV and facilitate precise positioning.</li>
            <li>Includes buttons for raising and lowering the platform.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Control System:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automation Circuitry:</strong> Includes relay circuits to control the adjustment motor, ensuring the EV is aligned automatically without manual intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>Return Control Circuit:</strong> Ensures the lifting platform returns to its initial position after alignment, maintaining system readiness for the next vehicle.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advantages:</h2>
        <h3>Precision Alignment:</h3>
        <p>Ensures accurate alignment of the EV with the charging interface, enhancing the efficiency of battery exchanges.</p>
        
        <h3>Automated Operation:</h3>
        <p>Reduces the need for manual adjustments, saving time and effort for users.</p>
        
        <h3>Enhanced Safety:</h3>
        <p>Securely positions the EV, preventing misalignment and potential damage during battery exchanges.</p>
        
        <h3>Improved Efficiency:</h3>
        <p>The automatic system speeds up the alignment process, supporting high-throughput EV charging stations.</p>
        
        <h3>Scalability:</h3>
        <p>Suitable for integration into various EV charging platforms, making it adaptable for widespread use.</p>
        
        <h2>Detailed Components:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Horizontal Positioning Bar:</strong> Ensures front and rear positioning rods remain parallel.</li>
            <li><strong>Conical Positioning Buttons:</strong> Elastic buttons that fit into the conical slots on the EV, providing secure alignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Relays:</strong> Manage the direction and operation of the adjustment motor based on the positioning of the rods and slots.</li>
            <li><strong>Return Mechanism:</strong> Ensures the lifting platform and alignment device return to their starting positions after each use, readying the system for the next EV.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This device enhances the efficiency and reliability of EV battery exchange stations by automating the alignment process, ensuring quick and accurate battery replacements.</p>
