        <h1>An Electric Vehicle Battery Module for Quick Replacement</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>This patent describes an electric vehicle (EV) battery module designed to facilitate the rapid replacement of batteries. It aims to overcome the challenges of battery size differences, lack of real-time monitoring, and cumbersome manual battery replacement.</p>
        
        <h2>Principle:</h2>
        <p>The battery module includes standardized components and automated systems to streamline the battery replacement process. Key components and their functions are as follows:</p>
        
        <h3>Standardized Battery Housing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed relative to the front axle of the EV.</li>
            <li>Ensures consistent positioning for easy battery replacement.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Battery Components:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Battery Body:</strong> Includes left and right side protective covers.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication Module:</strong> Features an identification chip and signal transmitter for real-time monitoring and communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring and Alarm Module:</strong> Monitors battery status and triggers alarms if battery levels drop below a threshold.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Automatic Door and Battery Fixation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Door System:</strong> Operated by a stepper motor controlled from the driver's cabin to open and close the battery compartment door.</li>
            <li><strong>Battery Fixation System:</strong> Uses automatic screws and motor-driven pulleys to secure the battery in place, ensuring stability during operation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Battery Transfer System:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes multiple transmission rollers and a telescopic coupling that connects the internal battery shaft to external power sources.</li>
            <li>Allows for smooth insertion and removal of the battery from the housing.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advantages:</h2>
        <h3>Quick and Automated Battery Replacement:</h3>
        <p>The system's automation minimizes manual intervention, reducing the time required to replace batteries.</p>
        
        <h3>Enhanced Monitoring and Communication:</h3>
        <p>Real-time monitoring and communication capabilities enable proactive management of battery health and efficient scheduling of replacements.</p>
        
        <h3>Universal Design:</h3>
        <p>Standardized components ensure compatibility across different EV models, making the system versatile and scalable for widespread adoption.</p>
        
        <h3>Improved Safety and Efficiency:</h3>
        <p>Automated mechanisms and secure fixation enhance safety during battery changes and ensure reliable operation of the EV.</p>
