        <h1>A Three-Dimensional Layered Electric Vehicle Battery Swapping Station</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>This patent describes a multi-layered electric vehicle (EV) battery swapping station designed to handle a high volume of vehicles efficiently.</p>
        
        <h2>Principle:</h2>
        <p>The station consists of multiple battery swapping layers, each equipped with standardized battery modules, battery swapping controllers, automated positioning modules, and conveyor belts. The layers are stacked to save space and ensure smooth entry and exit of vehicles. The station uses infrared sensors and electromagnets for precise battery swapping, reducing downtime and facilitating large-scale deployment.</p>

        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple Swapping Layers:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each layer includes parking positions, standardized battery modules, controllers for swapping and charging, automated positioning modules, and conveyors.</li>
                    <li>Layers are stacked to save space and allow independent entry and exit routes for vehicles, making the process smooth and efficient.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Automated Control and Positioning:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The battery swapping controller is equipped with infrared sensors and an electromagnetic system for precise battery handling.</li>
                    <li>Automated positioning ensures the accurate alignment of batteries during the swapping process.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Charging System:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Includes a rotating charging turntable with multiple charging slots.</li>
                    <li>Supports different configurations to meet the demands of various urban densities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Power Supply Module:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connects to external power sources and includes a photovoltaic solar power module for additional power supply.</li>
                    <li>Ensures continuous operation even during power outages.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Monitoring and Control:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each layer can be monitored and managed independently.</li>
                    <li>The system includes computers and display screens for overall station management.</li>
                    <li>Uses network control software to facilitate information exchange between different layers and the main control system.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Efficient and Reasonable Billing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Charges based on actual electricity consumption rather than a flat fee per swap, ensuring accurate and fair billing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
