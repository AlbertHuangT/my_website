    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>This patent details an automated lifting system for mounting and exchanging electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The system aims to streamline the battery swapping process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
        
        <h2>Principle:</h2>
        <p>The system consists of several key components designed to automate the lifting, lowering, and transferring of EV batteries:</p>
        
        <h3>Trapezoidal Battery Compartment:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Located at the bottom of the EV, it matches the shape of the battery and facilitates secure placement.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Battery Mounting Columns:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front and Rear Mounting Columns:</strong> These columns are connected to the automatic lifting systems and support the battery frame (basket).</li>
            <li><strong>Battery Basket:</strong> A frame that holds the battery, equipped with left and right frames to support the battery ends.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Automatic Lifting Systems:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front and Rear Lifting Systems:</strong> Each includes a drive motor, drive screw, and lifting nut to raise and lower the mounting columns and battery basket.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Battery Transfer Mechanism:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Passing Module:</strong> A grid structure that allows the EV to pass over while also housing a battery transfer system.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission Rollers:</strong> Embedded in the grid structure, these rollers facilitate the movement of the battery to and from the charging platform.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Battery Positioning and Connection:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Left Positioning Baffle:</strong> Aligns the battery with the power supply and charging connectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive and Negative Connection Posts:</strong> Ensure secure electrical connections for charging and power supply.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advantages:</h2>
        <h3>Automated Battery Exchange:</h3>
        <p>Reduces manual intervention, speeding up the battery swapping process.</p>
        
        <h3>Precise Positioning:</h3>
        <p>Ensures accurate alignment and secure placement of the battery using positioning cones and slots.</p>
        
        <h3>Efficient Charging Integration:</h3>
        <p>The system seamlessly transfers batteries to the charging platform and back to the vehicle once charged.</p>
        
        <h3>Enhanced Safety and Reliability:</h3>
        <p>Automated lifting and positioning reduce the risk of mishandling and ensure consistent operation.</p>
        
        <h2>Detailed Operation:</h2>
        <h3>Battery Removal:</h3>
        <p>The EV drives into the battery exchange station, aligning with the front tire limit slot.</p>
        <p>The driver presses the battery exchange confirmation button, triggering the lowering of the vehicle passing module and exposing the transmission rollers.</p>
        <p>The automatic lifting systems lower the battery basket, placing the battery onto the transmission rollers.</p>
        <p>The battery is then transferred to the charging platform.</p>
        
        <h3>Battery Installation:</h3>
        <p>A fully charged battery is transferred from the charging platform to the EV’s battery compartment via the transmission rollers.</p>
        <p>The automatic lifting systems raise the battery basket, engaging the positioning cones with the battery's positioning slots, ensuring a secure fit.</p>
        <p>The system confirms the battery is in place and locks it securely.</p>
        <p>The vehicle passing module is raised back to its initial position, allowing the EV to drive away.</p>
        
        <p>This automated system enhances the efficiency and reliability of battery exchanges in electric vehicles, supporting faster turnaround times and reducing downtime.</p>
