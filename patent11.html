        <h3>Comprehensive Database:</h3>
        <p>Establishes a database of stable and efficient coating materials, facilitating the development of high-performance secondary batteries.</p>
        
        <h2>Applications:</h2>
        <h3>Electrode Material:</h3>
        <p>The method produces electrode materials with core-shell structures, where the core is the electrode active material, and the shell is the screened coating material. This structure enhances the overall capacity and stability of the electrodes.</p>
        
        <h3>Secondary Battery:</h3>
        <p>The improved electrode materials are used to manufacture secondary batteries with higher energy density, better cycle stability, and longer lifespan.</p>
