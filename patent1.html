        <p>This patent describes a smart manhole cover and its real-time monitoring system. The system includes a base, outer cover, inner cover, and a monitoring alarm module. The outer and inner covers are hinged to the base. The monitoring alarm module includes a glass ring tube for monitoring cover breakage, a monitoring valve, an audio-visual alarm module, a communication module, and a power module. The valve is connected to the alarm and communication modules. When the outer cover is damaged, the monitoring module alerts pedestrians and notifies management personnel to address the issue promptly, preventing safety hazards.</p>
