        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>This patent describes a safe and intelligent manhole cover designed to prevent accidents caused by damaged or missing covers and to facilitate real-time monitoring.</p>
        
        <h2>Principle:</h2>
        <p>The manhole cover system consists of an outer and inner cover, both hinged to a base. It includes a monitoring and alarm module with a glass ring tube filled with liquid that detects damage. If the outer cover breaks, the liquid leaks, triggering a valve that activates sound and light alarms and sends an alert through a communication module. This system ensures immediate notification of potential hazards to pedestrians and maintenance personnel, enhancing safety and allowing for prompt response to issues.</p>
