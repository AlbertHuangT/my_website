        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>This patent introduces a high-frequency oscillating direct current (DC) charging system controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The system aims to improve the efficiency and speed of charging batteries, particularly for electric vehicles, by using high-frequency pulse modulation.</p>
        
        <h2>Principle:</h2>
        <p>The system comprises several key components:</p>
        
        <h3>High-Frequency Pulse Control Output Module:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> PS switch power supply, PLC programmable controller, pulse boost transformer.</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Generates high-frequency pulse DC signals (20,000 Hz, 0-5V) which are then amplified to 0-30V by the pulse boost transformer.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Three-Phase Transformer:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Input coil and two output coils.</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Connects to a 380V AC power supply to form a current loop and assists in boosting the voltage for the charging process.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>High-Frequency Pulse Charging Module:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Two pulse DC oscillating charging circuits, each including a three-phase transformer output coil, a battery pack, and a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR).</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Converts the amplified high-frequency pulse signals into intermittent, sawtooth-shaped high-voltage DC pulses (0-1000V) to charge the battery pack efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Silicon-Controlled Rectifier (SCR):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Components:</strong> Anode (A), Cathode (K), Control Gate (G).</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Controls the flow of high-frequency pulse signals through the charging circuit, synchronized by the PLC and the pulse boost transformer.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advantages:</h2>
        <h3>Increased Charging Efficiency:</h3>
        <p>Utilizes high-frequency pulses to enhance the battery's ability to accept charge, breaking the limitations of conventional charging methods.</p>
        
        <h3>Rapid Charging:</h3>
        <p>The system's ability to generate intermittent high-voltage pulses allows for quicker charging cycles, reducing overall charging time.</p>
        
        <h3>Enhanced Battery Life:</h3>
        <p>The oscillating pulses reduce internal pressure and gas generation within the battery, improving its longevity and performance.</p>
        
        <h3>Flexible and Adjustable:</h3>
        <p>The PLC allows for precise control of pulse amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle, adapting the charging process to different battery types and conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PLC Programming:</strong> The controller manages the generation and timing of high-frequency pulses, ensuring optimal charging conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Pulse Boost Transformer:</strong> Amplifies the initial low-voltage pulses to high-voltage pulses suitable for efficient battery charging.</li>
            <li><strong>Synchronization Circuit:</strong> Ensures the SCRs operate in sync with the high-frequency pulses, maintaining stable and effective charging.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Detailed Operation:</h2>
        <p>The system begins by converting 220V AC to 24V DC using the PS switch power supply to power the PLC.</p>
        <p>The PLC generates high-frequency pulse signals, which are then amplified by the pulse boost transformer.</p>
        <p>These amplified pulses are used to control the SCRs, which in turn regulate the flow of high-voltage pulses to the battery pack.</p>
        <p>The oscillating nature of the pulses allows for intermittent charging, giving the battery time to absorb the charge effectively and reducing gas formation.</p>
        <p>This high-frequency oscillating charging system represents an advanced solution for fast and efficient battery charging, particularly suited for electric vehicles, where reducing downtime and enhancing battery life are critical.</p>
