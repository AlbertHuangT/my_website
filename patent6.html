        <h1>A Rotating Charging Platform for Quick Battery Replacement in Electric Vehicles</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>This patent introduces a rotating charging platform designed for the quick swapping and charging of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. It aims to address the inefficiencies in current EV charging and battery replacement systems.</p>
        
        <h2>Principle:</h2>
        <p>The platform consists of several key components:</p>
        
        <h3>Rotating Charging Turntable:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes inner and outer circular tracks with multiple battery charging positions arranged at intervals.</li>
            <li>Each charging position has transmission rollers and a transmission shaft for battery movement.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Turntable Walking Module:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Located on the right side of the turntable, it drives the step-by-step rotation of the charging platform.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Battery Charging Module:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously charges multiple batteries placed in the charging positions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Central Fixed Platform:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Located inside the left end of the turntable, it houses the walking module and battery exchange controller.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Walking Module:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes a transmission motor, transmission shaft, gears, and a retractable coupling.</li>
            <li>Coordinates with the battery exchange controller to manage battery movement on the turntable.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Battery Exchange Controller:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Positioned on a conveyor belt, it ensures smooth battery transfer.</li>
            <li>Facilitates the movement of charged batteries off the turntable and uncharged batteries onto it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advantages:</h2>
        <h3>Simultaneous Charging and Replacement:</h3>
        <p>The turntable structure allows multiple batteries to be charged simultaneously and replaced sequentially based on their charging status.</p>
        
        <h3>Automated and Efficient Operation:</h3>
        <p>The integration of automated systems enhances the efficiency of battery replacement, reducing the need for manual intervention.</p>
        
        <h3>High Capacity and Scalability:</h3>
        <p>Capable of handling a large number of batteries, making it suitable for large-scale EV deployments.</p>
        
        <h3>Integrated Monitoring and Control:</h3>
        <p>The system includes modules for real-time monitoring of battery status, ensuring effective management and timely replacement.</p>
        
        <h3>Streamlined Design:</h3>
        <p>The compact and organized structure facilitates easy operation and maintenance, improving overall efficiency.</p>
        
        <h2>Detailed Components:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Battery Charging Positions:</strong> Each position includes rollers and gears for moving and positioning batteries.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission Mechanisms:</strong> Ensure precise movement and alignment of batteries during the charging and replacement processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Retractable Coupling:</strong> Connects the transmission shaft to the battery positions, enabling smooth transfer and secure fixation.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrared Sensors:</strong> Used for detecting battery positions and coordinating the movement of the exchange controller.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Supply System:</strong> Includes power poles and cables for delivering electricity to the batteries, equipped with safety features to prevent overcharging.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This system is designed to meet the growing demand for efficient and large-scale EV battery management, providing a practical solution for rapid battery replacement and simultaneous charging.</p>
